# Quality Systems

Quality Systems is a package of forms, data, & workflows to implement a comprehensive quality system.

The package is a v1 release, and includes the basics:

* Corrective and Preventative Actions
* Customer Issues
* Supplier Issues
* Non-Conformance Report
* Stop Ship
* Hold Notice
* Material Purges

Still to do: dashboards, metrics, form-to-form automation, and [admin | end-user] documentation of the solution.

Also would be good to add a repository for ISO procedures.

> NOTE: This project has been replaced by the [Aras Quality Management System application](http://www.aras.com/applications/quality-management-system.aspx).
